"""
    logdensity(model, θ)

Return the log density for `model` at parameter `θ`.

A *model* is an object that can behave as a probability distribution over some
space, possibly by simulation (see [`simulate`](@ref)).
"""
function logdensity end

"""
    simulate!(model)

Re-generate the simulated shocks for `model`. For Monte Carlo calculation of
integrals, `model` should save appropriate shocks, independent of
parameters. Evaluations of [`logdensity`](@ref) then transform these using the
parameters.
"""

"""
Random walk Metropolis-Hastings.

In this library, it is provided purely for testing and pedagogical purposes. See
[`NUTS`](@ref) for a more practical alternative.
"""

    Σ::S
end

"""
    propose(transition, model, θ)

Generate a Metropolis-Hastings proposal using the given `transition` algorithm
and `model`, starting from parameters `θ`.

Return `θ′, a` where `θ′` is the proposed new parameter and `a` is the
acceptance probability.

The method `logdensity(model, θ)` needs to be supported by the arguments.

"""
    mcmc(transition, model, θ, N)

Runs a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm by calling [`propose`](@ref)
repeatedly `N` times. After each iteration, re-simulate the shocks for model
using `simulate!`.

Return the vector of parameters, and the average acceptance rate.

The following interface needs to be supported by the arguments: -
`logposterior(model, θ)`, `simulate!(model)`.
